# cvent

Cvent is a website for medical professionals to give advice, tutorials and other information to others who need to learn.

The core website will consist of:
- Informative pages
- Videos that can be purchased that will hold exams and give certs to passing exam takers
- Mobile application for the videos

Second part of the project will be a website builder that can be used for outside clinic and doctors. So this must be intuitive and easy to use. Most likely drag and drop.
